# Contribution Guide

We intend for this to be as up-to-date as possible, so there's a lot of help we need to make this so.

A lot of our content is gotten from the [Nigeria Law](https://nigeria-law.org) website. Some of it is in PDF, so it's a bit tasking to copy, paste and format in a readble markdown document.

We'll use issues to mark sections we need help with. If you want to work on an issue, follow this guide:

- Read the Formatting Guide below.

- Assign the Issue to yourself to indicate interest.

- Comment on how you intend to fix the issue to get feedback.

- Fork this Repository

- Make edits or contributions in your Fork

- Create a Pull-Request with "fixes #[issue-no]" somewhere in its title.

- Sit back and watch your PR merged.

## Formatting Guide and Naming Conventions

Please follow these conventions.

- All text files must be in valid markdown format.

- All markdown files except README.md must be in lowercase, with words separated by hyphens.

    E.g. nigerian-constitution.md ✅

    "Nigerian Constitution.md" ❌

    "Nigerian-Constitution.md" ❌
